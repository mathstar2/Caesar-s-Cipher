This application should just run if you run the command ./encrypt.  (Assuming you are running this in linux).
When running ./encrypt, you will first be prompted to put text that needs to be encrypted, after hitting enter, you then will enter the shift that you want to use.  If you use shift one, A goes to B, B goes to C etc.  Using shift two causes A to go to C, B goes to D, C goes to E etc.  After typing both, you will get the encrypted text.  
While the program doesn't have an explicit decrypt function, it is possible to decrypt a statement given to you.  Lets say someone sends you lipps, it is hello encrypted by a shift of 4.  To decrypt this, you would do 26 - 4 = 22 and that would be your new shift.  So you would enter lipps for Text: , and 22 for Shift: , which returns the Cipher hello.
This relates to group theory, it is a group operation as the program shifts the letters from the original text and turns it into the encrypted text.  This is an isomorphism, as it is a 1-1 mapping from our original alphabet to a "new alphabet."  While this new alphabet is unreadable to a regular english speaker, it is still functionally the same, since the encrypted text is just changed by a shift of x letters.  This is known as a Caesar's cipher, and is used in cryptography to send messages that you don't want people to see.  While it is a simplier cipher, it is still nevertheless a useful one to prevent people from looking into your personal conversations.
